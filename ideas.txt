Does the turtle need an introspection module?
  I could add another restock/refuel chest

NOTE: pickaxe doesn't show up when equipped and scanner has a different name

second turtle restock chest?
  one for saplings one for fuel?
  no, turtle should be able to wrap the chest to get what it needs
    if not then the furnace manager could always keep only a few of each item in there

TODO: safety move
  move with location tracking (lama rewrite) and entity blocking waiting (if can't move because player/mob is in the way then wait for the player/mob to move)

to make use of the block sensor the farmer could swap out the pickaxe and swap back as needed
  if we want big trees then I need to use it to detect lone logs instead of tree trunks
  NOTE: what is the range of the scanner? #homeOnly

use one of those schematic builders?

we have plethora, we can wrap chests to get their slots
have the furnace manager drive monitors for a status screen?
neual interface for status updates

allow the moon turf instead of cobble

can saplings be planted on moon turf? no

TODO: try out unit testing stuff #homeOnly #high
  write tests for checkpoint

	Howl task?
  starting to wish for a ldoc like thing in the same vain as mcfly compared with busted - SquidDev is working on a thing

how to init config

TODO: how do I want the remote control system to work?
  especially if I replace nsh with my own thing
    with nsh compatibility?


NOTE: can we have too much wood to smelt?
  could we be unable to catch up?
    the farmer could stop if the smelter says so

TODO: location placer
  pocket computer app which lets the user know how big the farm will be and tells the turtles where to build it

don't bother with a peer to peer system or a server?
  can only have one farming turtle then
  peer to peer could be useful to hive?
  how to handle desync?

let turtles have pairings, that way multiple farms can be in range of each other and not have cross talk

Handy__Andy has a advanced pocket computer

wireless modems are cheap
  rednet range during thunder, about 19
    during ideal conditions, about 67

Incremental construction of farm?
  farming turtle need to hang onto the water bucket but ideally should not be programmed to know of the bucket

Request building equipment with label

Lost and found(including apples) and spare construction material chests

if the system runs out of saplings then place more in the sapling chest
  saplings will get used as fuel for the turtles and furnaces with charcoal as a backup -- NOTE: this is not currently true
  what to do when the chests are full?
    message the turtle to stop


TODO: programmatic locations

lama overrides real gps, if they conflict then lama is used
  TODO: edit lama to have reference frames

max logs per tree = 6
  low roof prevents branches

TODO: Allow a chest for placing build items
  may need two so that the turtle can sort
