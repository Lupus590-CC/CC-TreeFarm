Incremental construction of farm?

Request with label

Lost and found and spare construction material box

if the system runs out of saplings then place more in the sapling chest
  spalings will get used as fuel for the turtles and furnaces with charcoal as a backup

if using two turtles then I my not need to have them able to navigate arround eachother as their zones of work won't cross each other. (building may be an exception)

do I need modems?
two turtles
  tree chopping turtle
    drops the logs into the water and builds the place
  smelting turtle
    collects logs and saplings from bottom chest and sorts and uses furnaces

low roof prevents branches

size = 14*5*2 = 140
time taken to cut one tree = 10
time taken to clear farm = 1400
30 mins in seconds = 30 * 60 = 1800

max logs per tree = 6
