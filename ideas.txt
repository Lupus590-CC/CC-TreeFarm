update detector?

how to init config

can I make it so that there are multiple furnace managing turtles?

TODO: check indents for all files

NOTE: can we have too much wood to smelt?
	could we be unable to catch up?

make the whole farm stackable?
	only need to put jack o'lantern and dirt
	  jack o'lantern can act as tree height capping block

Computer server?

has advanced pocket computer

wireless modems are cheap

Incremental construction of farm?
	farming turtle need to hang onto the water bucket but ideally should not be programmed to know of the bucket

Request with label

Lost and found(apples) and spare construction material chests

if the system runs out of saplings then place more in the sapling chest
  saplings will get used as fuel for the turtles and furnaces with charcoal as a backup -- NOT: this is not currently true
	what to do when the chests are full?

if using two turtles then I my not need to have them able to navigate around each other as their zones of work won't cross each other. (building may be an exception)
	with modems, turtles may be able to negotiate navigating around each other
		can I get polite navigation with redstone only?


two turtles
  tree chopping turtle
    drops the logs into the water and builds the place
  smelting turtle
    collects logs and saplings from bottom chest and sorts and uses furnaces

logging turtles divide tasks into rows
	turtle with one row: chop away from chests, wait for regrowth, chop towards chests, restock,  wait for regrowth

waiting for regrowth: -- hive will need this for tasks anyways -- depends on the task, trees don't grow unless the chunk is loaded.
	use timers?
		hard to save to file
		immune to player sleeping
	use target clock?
		jumps forward when the player sleeps without actual growth progress
		easy to save
	use both
		save the target clock and use a timer to alert to that, if the clock suddenly changes the update the file
	use real world time
		no easy way to access in old CC
		will jump between world loads (same with others)
	watch a sapling
		some others could have grown ages ago, this wastes time
	have a file with seconds to wait
		update the file every 5 seconds
		if the chunk is unloaded then the computer won't be able to update the file, when the chunk is loaded again then the trees will resume growing and the computer will resume the count down

size = 14*5*2 = 140
time taken to cut one tree = 10
time taken to clear farm = 1400
30 mins in seconds = 30 * 60 = 1800

max logs per tree = 6

Allow a chest for placing build items
	may need two so that the turtle can sort
