If I have multiple turtles then will there be enough fuel?
  might not be worth it, the turtle already spends most of the time waiting
    perhaps I should make it multiple levels, with one turtle handling it all
      how would this effect rednet range?

how to init config

TODO: is the farm small enough that a rednet repeater is not needed?
  test near bedrock during a thunderstorm
  maybe, max needed range is about 16 blocks
  range during thunderstorm at y-level that Handy__Andy plans to deploy this at is about 17 blocks. That's not a lot of wiggle room.
  more testing needed
  the farm has a bit more upper space, perhaps a repeater can be placed here? TODO: place a repeater at farm max and test again

TODO: check and fix indentation #high

NOTE: can we have too much wood to smelt?
  could we be unable to catch up?

make the whole farm stackable?
  only need to put jack o'lantern and dirt
    jack o'lantern can act as tree height capping block

don't bother with a peer to peer system or a server?
  can only have one farming turtle then
  peer to peer could be useful to hive?
  how to handle desync?

Computer server?
  arguably more useful to hive
  if desync then server is right (even if it isn't)

Handy__Andy has a advanced pocket computer

wireless modems are cheap
  rednet range during thunder, about 19
    during ideal conditions, about 67

Incremental construction of farm?
  farming turtle need to hang onto the water bucket but ideally should not be programmed to know of the bucket

Request building equipment with label

Lost and found(including apples) and spare construction material chests

if the system runs out of saplings then place more in the sapling chest
  saplings will get used as fuel for the turtles and furnaces with charcoal as a backup -- NOT: this is not currently true
  what to do when the chests are full?

if using two turtles then I my not need to have them able to navigate around each other as their zones of work won't cross each other. (building may be an exception)
  with modems, turtles may be able to negotiate navigating around each other
  can I get polite navigation with redstone only?


two turtles
  tree chopping turtle
    drops the logs into the water and builds the place
  smelting turtle
    collects logs and saplings from bottom chest and sorts and uses furnaces

logging turtles divide tasks into rows
  turtle with one row: chop away from chests, wait for regrowth, chop towards chests, restock,  wait for regrowth

Lowest allowed point = 20
Highest allowed point = 75
TODO: how tall is the farm?
  8 blocks for the tree part (stackable)
  4? for the trench (not stackable)
  if I stack it then part doesn't need to be replicated
    do I need multiple sapling catchers/movers?
      depends if the leaves keep catching them
        might be able to mitigate by always chopping from the bottom of the farm
      I might want to remove the inner most tree line too
  might be able to stack them upto 5 or 6 times
size = 14*5*2 = 140
time taken to cut one tree = 10
time taken to clear farm = 1400
30 mins in seconds = 30 * 60 = 1800

max logs per tree = 6
  low roof prevents branches

TODO: Allow a chest for placing build items
  may need two so that the turtle can sort

Required items list
  1406 packed ice
  8 furnace
  2 water bucket
  140 jack o'lantern
  140 dirt
  10 chest
  9999? stone or cobblestone (mixing is fine)
  2 hopper
  12 torch
  32 fence post
  2 wireless modem
  2 turtle
  1 diamond pickaxe
  1 oak sapling (more is better)
  A bunch of fuel for the turtles - not sure how much yet
