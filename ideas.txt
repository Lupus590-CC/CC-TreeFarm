Incremental construction of farm?

Request with label

Lost and found and spare construction material box

if the system runs out of saplings then place more in the sapling chest
  saplings will get used as fuel for the turtles and furnaces with charcoal as a backup

if using two turtles then I my not need to have them able to navigate around each other as their zones of work won't cross each other. (building may be an exception)

do I need modems?
two turtles
  tree chopping turtle
    drops the logs into the water and builds the place
  smelting turtle
    collects logs and saplings from bottom chest and sorts and uses furnaces
	
logging turtles divide tasks into rows
	turtle with one row: chop away from chests, wait for regrowth, chop towards chests, restock,  wait for regrowth

waiting for regrowth:
	use timers?
		hard to save to file
		immune to player sleeping
	use target clock?
		jumps forward when the player sleeps without actual growth progress
		easy to save
	use both
		save the target clock and use a timer to alert to that, if the clock suddenly changes the update the file
	use real world time
		no easy way to access in old CC
		will jump between world loads (same with others)
	watch a sapling
		some others could have grown ages ago, this wastes time
	
low roof prevents branches

size = 14*5*2 = 140
time taken to cut one tree = 10
time taken to clear farm = 1400
30 mins in seconds = 30 * 60 = 1800

max logs per tree = 6
